MiVet is a mobile and web application whose mission is to streamline equine veterinary services by making it easier to find and
communicate with a provider. MiVet is an MVP and due to the proprietary nature of the code I can only provide code snippents of my code. This repository contains SQL, .NET, and React code for the External Links feature.
